# Stream Deck Claude Meter

A real-time Claude API token usage meter for your Elgato Stream Deck. Animates as Claude thinks, fills as context grows, and resets cleanly between sessions — all driven by Claude Code's hook system.

## What it does

| State | Visual | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| **Thinking** | Red snake animates through the grid | Before each tool call |
| **In use** | Grid fills with token count | After each tool call |
| **Idle** | Grid pulses gently | No active session |
| **Press key** | Resets to zero | Manual reset |

The fill level represents how much of Claude's context window you've consumed (default cap: 200k tokens).

---

## Requirements

- [Elgato Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/stream-deck) hardware
- [Stream Deck software](https://www.elgato.com/downloads) 6.4+
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI
- Node.js 20+ (for building; Stream Deck ships its own runtime)
- bash + Python 3 (for hooks — standard on macOS, available via Git Bash on Windows)

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mishigo-co/claude-code-meter-for-stream-deck
cd streamdeck-claude-meter
npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. Link the plugin to Stream Deck

```bash
npx streamdeck link com.mishigo.claude-meter.sdPlugin
npx streamdeck dev   # enables developer mode (one-time)
```

Then restart the Stream Deck app. The **Claude Meter** action will appear in your actions list — drag it onto a key.

### 3. Wire up the hooks

Add the following to your `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash /path/to/streamdeck-claude-meter/hooks/pre-tool-use.sh" }]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash /path/to/streamdeck-claude-meter/hooks/post-tool-use.sh" }]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "bash /path/to/streamdeck-claude-meter/hooks/stop.sh" }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/streamdeck-claude-meter` with your actual clone path. Restart Claude Code for hooks to take effect.

## How it works

```
Claude Code lifecycle hooks
         │
         ▼
  HTTP POST → localhost:3141/update
         │
         ▼
  Plugin HTTP server (server.ts)
         │
         ▼
  ClaudeMeterAction state update
         │
         ▼
  50ms tick → renderFrame() → setImage()
         │
         ▼
  Stream Deck key display
```

Three hooks drive the meter:

- **`pre-tool-use.sh`** — Fires before every tool call. Sends `{ isThinking: true }` → starts the snake animation.
- **`post-tool-use.sh`** — Fires after every tool call. Parses the token count from stdin and sends `{ tokens: N }` → fills the grid.
- **`stop.sh`** — Fires on session end or `/clear`. Sends the final token count or resets to idle.

The plugin runs a lightweight HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:3141`. The hooks are the only clients — nothing is sent to any external service.

---

## Development

```bash
npm run watch        # rebuild on file changes
npx streamdeck restart com.mishigo.claude-meter   # restart plugin after rebuild
```

### Customisation

**Animation speed** — in `src/utils/renderCharacter.ts`, change the phase increment in the
50 ms tick (`src/actions/claude-meter.ts`):

```typescript
this.phase = (this.phase + 0.02) % 1;  // smaller = slower
```

For colours and the character itself, see **Characters** below.

---

## Characters

The animated face is a **character pack** — a small JSON file holding a 12×12 base silhouette and a
colour palette. The face expressions and motion (blink, thinking dots, Z's, sparkles, typing bars)
are shared in code, so every character animates the same way; packs only change the body shape and
colours.

**Pick a character** — select the key in Stream Deck and use the **Character** dropdown in the
property inspector. Seven are bundled: Claude, Robo, Cat, Ghost, Slime, Alien, Pumpkin.

**Import your own** — click **Import character…** in the property inspector and choose a `.json` pack.
Imported packs are stored in the plugin's global settings (no files to manage) and appear in the
dropdown for every key. Bad files are rejected with an inline error.

**Pack format** (`schema: 1`):

```jsonc
{
  "schema": 1,
  "id": "robo",            // unique id; re-importing the same id replaces it
  "name": "Robo",          // shown in the dropdown
  "palette": {             // all nine roles required, each a #rrggbb hex
    "bg": "#000000", "body": "#22AACC", "shade": "#116688", "hilit": "#66E0FF",
    "white": "#FFFFFF", "pupil": "#001824", "dark": "#002A38", "gray": "#557788", "lgray": "#99CCDD"
  },
  // 12 rows × 12 chars. Legend: '.'=transparent  B=body S=shade H=hilit W=white D=dark G=gray L=lgray
  "base": [
    "....HH......", "....SS......", ".SSSSSSSSSS.", ".SBBBBBBBBS.",
    ".SBBBBBBBBS.", ".SBBBBBBBBS.", ".SBBBBBBBBS.", ".SSSSSSSSSS.",
    "...S.SS.S...", "..SBBBBBBS..", "..SBBBBBBS..", "..S.SSSS.S.."
  ],
  // optional — nudge the shared eyes/mouth to fit your silhouette (defaults shown)
  "anchors": { "eyeLeftX": 3, "eyeRightX": 7, "eyesY": 3, "mouthX": 4, "mouthY": 6 }
}
```

The bundled packs in `src/utils/characters.ts` are the canonical worked examples. To change Claude's
colours, edit the `claude` pack's `palette` there.

**Token cap** — currently fixed at 200,000 (the fill strip at the bottom of the key).

## Troubleshooting

**Plugin doesn't appear in Stream Deck**
- Run `npx streamdeck validate com.mishigo.claude-meter.sdPlugin` and fix any errors
- Restart Stream Deck after linking

**Animation doesn't start**
- Check the server is running: `curl http://127.0.0.1:3141/health`
- Check Stream Deck logs: `%APPDATA%\Elgato\StreamDeck\logs\StreamDeck.log`
- Make sure you restarted Claude Code after editing `settings.json`

**Token count not showing**
- Verify Python 3 is available: `python3 --version`
- On Windows, confirm Git Bash is installed and `bash` is in PATH

**Hooks not firing**
- Confirm hooks are in `~/.claude/settings.json` (global), not a project-level file
- Check hook paths use forward slashes, even on Windows
